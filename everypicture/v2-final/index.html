                            <p>This was a photo of a wood house on a pier in Lake Tahoe. It was taken at around last year's winter. I was wandering around with my friend to see the beautiful lake of Lake Tahoe, then it happens to be this time where the sunset was just happening and I happened to find this place. So, I captured a photo of this moment.</p>

                            <p>This photo of the San Francisco Peace Pagoda in Japantown was taken after watching the movie <em>Joker</em> (2019). I was walking down the street after finish watching the movie, then I found that the moon just happened to be right on top of the tower and aligns perfectly with the tower. So I took a photo of this moment because I know I won't be waiting there for hours just for this to happen another time.</p>

                            <p>The first time I went to Chicago. My family and I were on a tour bus cruising around downtown. It was winter, and we were sitting on the top deck, getting our faces blasted by freezing wind the whole time. The view in the photo is from when the tour bus was weaving through all those giant buildings in downtown.</p>

                            <p>Me, my sister, and my mom rented three bikes over by Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco and rode a pretty good stretch. We made it to the Golden Gate Bridge area.

                            <p>From the day after my friends and I went skiing—it was our chill day cruising around Lake Tahoe, stopping here and there to enjoy the beauty of the lake. I love how the water’s sparkling in this photo, with those reflections on the surface, and the pine trees framing it on the side add such a nice touch. The sunlight hitting the water and the clear blue sky above make it feel so peaceful.</p>
