                <h2>Creating User Friendly Forms</h2>
                <p>Creating forms that are easy to use is essential to improving user experience and increasing conversions. In order to minimize cognitive load and simplify the process, this <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">article</a> highlights the significance of reducing input fields. While dividing lengthy forms into several steps can greatly increase completion rates, a single-column structure is advised for efficiency. Confusion is avoided by clearly identifying mandatory and optional fields, and starting with simple questions encourages user commitment.</p>

User happiness also depends on being careful with default values and making sure input fields are the right size for the expected input.</p>
