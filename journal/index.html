                <h2 id="post5">Game Design Research</h2>
                <p>After reading <a href="https://www.juegostudio.com/blog/game-design-principles-every-game-designer-should-know">Game Design Principles</a>, here's what came to my mind. I play games too, mostly on my computer or phone, so I can understand their ideas. The ideas - clear goals, simple controls and rewards - are familiar to me. Take Super Mario, for example, you know you have to save the princess, and collecting coins keeps you wanting more. That's what they mean about goals and rewards. I've also rage-quit games that are confusing to operate, so the “game flow” bit is apt.</p>

                <p>What struck me, though, is how practical it all sounds. For example, playtesting - trying a game over and over again to make sure it's fun - is a step I'd probably skip if I were making a game in-house. But I understand that I've also been quick to give up on games that felt boring. The sound design part also got me thinking. Once I accidentally muted the sound on a horror game, and the game stopped being scary as a result, proving that they're right when they say sound is important.</p>

                <p>Overall, if you like games or want to make them, this is worth a read. It's not groundbreaking - most of it is common sense if you've played enough games - but it organizes the ideas in a coherent way. I wouldn't say this book changed my life, but for someone like me, who is more of a gamer than a creator, this book reminded me of what makes games tick.</p>

                <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/img-brian.jpg" alt="Photo taken by Brian Rodriguez-Torres" width="640">

                </figure>
                <p>The image appears to depict a building facade or roof surface composed of large, rectangular panels arranged in a regular, grid-like pattern. The panels are in a vivid blue color, while at the top edge there's a hint of a contrasting reddish or orange structure.</p>

                <p>The regular grid of rectangular panels creates an interesting and strong visual rhythm. The repeated lines and shapes are almost hypnotic in their consistency. The composition feels pared down to essentials: shape, line and color. Making the image appear almost like an abstract collage rather than a straightforward architectural photo.</p>

                <p>The interplay between the dominant blue surface and the narrow band of reddish-orange at the top adds a striking color contrast to the overall feeling of the photo. This subtle accent introduces visual interest to a monochromatic field of blue.</p>

                <p>It is clearly that it's some sort of building surface, a deliberate architectural arrangement of panels or tiles. The bold color scheme and the precise, modular design are immediately noticeable. And what's mysterious to me is the exact function or location of this structure. Is it a roof, a wall, or a decorative facade?</p>

                <p>Maybe the author could try to take the photo from a lower or more oblique angle to emphasize the lines and create dramatic diagonals. Or do some close-up shots which focus on the seams or edges between panels, capturing texture, subtle reflections, or tiny imperfections that could bring a different feel.</p>

                <p>This photo captures a peaceful lakefront scene at dusk. It's a calm picture of nature's beauty, and I found the location while walking around somewhere on Lake Tahoe, and I was able to frame the subtle holiday lights on the pier, mountains, and houseboats all in one composition.</p>

                <p>My archive focuses on landscape photography that highlights the interplay between water and sky, emphasizing the reflective qualities and ever-changing colors of twilight. This particular image fits perfectly because it shows how natural light can transform a simple lakeside structure into a striking silhouette. It also fits with the other pictures in my collection. I like to take pictures of nature at different times of day, like sunrise and sunset, when the world is changing slowly.</p>

                <p>My collection shows my search for solitude and reflection. I like to take pictures of places where water, sky, and man-made structures all go together, showing a sense of balance that I try to have in my own life. Each photograph shows that I am patient and calm, waiting for the perfect light or conditions. As time goes on, viewers can see the story of how my view of nature, tranquility, and the simple joys of witnessing a beautiful moment has changed.</p>

                <p>If I could go back and reshoot this image, I might shoot it in a different time and/or weather conditions. But if I couldn't, I will try to make it more engaging through some post-processing.</p>

                <h2>The Power of Visual Thinking</h2>
                <p>The archived <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">New York Times Learning Network</a> blog post "10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills" (2015) presents a collection of thought-provoking images designed to help students develop critical thinking, observational, and analytical skills.</p>

                <p>I find this resource very useful, especially for people who learn better by seeing things and those studying design, photography, or media. It encourages people to read images closely, which is an important part of knowing how to use visuals in fields like graphic design and branding. The selection of interesting photographs is a good way for students to learn to pay attention to what they see, which can be useful in many different subjects, like journalism and advertising.
                </p>
                
                <p>My work in visual storytelling and branding (like my branding project <em>NaChew</em> in DES 116) helps me convey messages through design. However, I think the post could be improved with updated content or interactive elements, such as modern case studies or digital tools for annotation. Nonetheless, it serves as a strong foundational guide for educators and students alike.</p>

                <h2>Designing Effective and User-Friendly Modals</h2>
                <p>This <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">article</a> on best practices for modals, overlays, and dialog windows gives a detailed guide on how to design a modal window that is user-friendly and effective. It emphasizes the importance of using modals wisely to grab user attention, collect input, or display additional information without losing the overall context. It also highlights key components of a well-designed modal, such as providing an escape hatch, using descriptive titles, actionable button labels, appropriate sizing and location, and a lightbox effect to draw focus. It also stresses the importance of accessibility, ensuring keyboard accessibility and using ARIA tags to enhance usability for all users.</p>

                <p>What stood out to me was the warning against using modals for error, success, or warning messages. It suggests that these should remain on the page to avoid interrupting user flow. The article also addresses the difficulties of using modals on mobile devices, and suggesting alternatives due to screen size and interaction issues.</p>

                <p>Overall, the article provides valuable insights and useful advice for designing modals that improve user experience without causing frustration. It encourages designers to consider the user’s perspective and prioritize accessibility and usability in their designs.</p>

                <h2>Creating User Friendly Forms</h2>
                <p>Creating forms that are easy to use is essential to improving user experience and increasing conversions. In order to minimize cognitive load and simplify the process, this <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">article</a> highlights the significance of reducing input fields. While dividing lengthy forms into several steps can greatly increase completion rates, a single-column structure is advised for efficiency. Confusion is avoided by clearly identifying mandatory and optional fields, and starting with simple questions encourages user commitment.</p>

                <p>Usability is improved by appropriately putting labels, ideally above input fields, particularly on mobile devices. It's best to utilize placeholder text carefully because it can occasionally work against you. User happiness also depends on being careful with default values and making sure input fields are the right size for the expected input.</p>

                <p>The user experience can be further improved by making sure forms are tab-ready and provide suitable keyboards for various mobile input types. Form abandonment can be decreased by providing a "show password" option and outlining the necessity of sensitive information. Lastly, it's crucial to avoid reset buttons, give clear form feedback, and design action buttons that are both noticeable and informative.</p>

                <p>By following these best practices, you can make forms that are not only simple to understand and fill out, but also have much higher conversion rates and make users happier overall.</p>

                <p>For instance, this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWOSmPwuNhbCxJlu8f_A-3CzAbBsTmkT1SK2dgkhJxmEEaZA/viewform">website</a> serves as an good example of incorporating some of the best practices. By having intuitive and straight forward questions and choices </p>
